4.Used open source models via Replicate Ai for other features
5.Used Clerk auth for sign in 
6.Used prisma orm and cockroach db for database.
### DISABLED ALL THE APIS FROM REPLICATE INCLUDNG THE OPEN SOURCE MODELS AS REPLICATE DOES NOT OFFER THE FREE TIER FOR APIS ANYMORE##
This was my 3rd next Js project(built in April), used good Youtube coding channels to get a beginner level understanding of next js and AI deployment.
